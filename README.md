# Tic_Tac_Toe_in_Love2D
This repository has the tic tac toe game I implemented as my proect on Fiverr in which I implemented tic tac toe using GUI on love2D game engine.

Game Name: Tic-Tac-Toe for IoT

Handbook:

1. Introduction:

This project aims to develop a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe suitable for IoT devices using Lua programming language.
2. Development Process:

Language Choice: Lua was chosen due to its lightweight nature, suitability for embedded systems, and ease of integration with IoT platforms.
Game Logic: The game logic was implemented to handle player turns, grid management, win conditions, and draw scenarios.
User Interaction: Players input their moves via coordinates, keeping the user interaction simple and intuitive.
Testing: Extensive testing was conducted to ensure the game runs smoothly on IoT devices, considering limitations such as memory constraints and processing power.
3. Rationale:

Simplicity: The game was intentionally kept simple to ensure it runs efficiently on resource-constrained IoT devices.
Player Experience: Emphasis was placed on providing a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience within the constraints of IoT platforms.
Compatibility: The code was designed to be easily portable to different IoT platforms with minimal modifications.
4. Challenges:

Resource Constraints: Adapting the game to run smoothly on IoT devices presented challenges due to limited memory and processing capabilities.
Input Handling: Implementing robust input validation while maintaining simplicity posed a challenge, especially considering various input formats.
Platform Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility across different IoT platforms required thorough testing and optimization.
5. Strengths:

Efficiency: The game is optimized for resource usage, ensuring smooth performance on IoT devices.
Portability: The code is designed to be easily portable to various IoT platforms, enhancing its versatility.
Scalability: The modular structure allows for easy expansion and customization of features in future iterations.
6. Areas for Improvement:

Input Handling: Enhance input validation to handle a wider range of user inputs and edge cases.
Graphics: Implement basic graphics or ASCII art to improve the visual appeal of the game.
Localization: Add support for multiple languages to make the game accessible to a broader audience.
7. Conclusion:

The development of Tic-Tac-Toe for IoT demonstrates the feasibility of creating simple yet engaging games for resource-constrained devices using Lua. While the current implementation meets the basic requirements, there is room for further improvement and customization to enhance the overall gaming experience.
